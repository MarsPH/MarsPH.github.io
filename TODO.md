# Responsiveness Fix Plan Breakdown

## Current Work
- Responsiveness fixes completed for the portfolio site.
- Applied clamp() functions for fluid sizing, converted units to responsive ones (vw, vh, rem), fixed hero layout by removing fixed widths and ensuring 100% on mobile, adjusted projects grid minmax for better mobile fit, and enhanced mobile media queries especially for max-width:576px.

## Key Technical Concepts
- CSS clamp(): Used for responsive sizing that scales between min, preferred, and max values.
- Media Queries: Enhanced breakpoints at 768px and 576px for tablet and phone respectively.
- Grid/Flexbox: Adjusted grid-template-columns to 1fr on mobile, made heights auto with min-height for flexibility.
- Viewport Units: Incorporated vw/vh for scalable dimensions.

## Relevant Files and Code
- **style.css**
  - Hero section: Changed .hero-visual and .hero-text to width:100% for mobile stacking.
  - Buttons: Made padding responsive with clamp().
  - Projects grid: Adjusted minmax to clamp(250px, 25vw, 350px).
  - Media queries: Added specific rules for @media (max-width: 576px) including projects grid to 1fr, heights to auto.

## Problem Solving
- Fixed overflows by ensuring widths are 100% on mobile and using clamp for sizing.
- Prevented overlaps by making avatar and other elements responsive.
- Improved text wrapping with word-wrap and hyphens.
