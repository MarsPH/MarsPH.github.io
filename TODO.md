# Responsiveness Fix Plan Breakdown

## Current Work
- Analyzed index.html and style.css for layout issues.
- Hero section uses Bootstrap but overridden by custom CSS causing misalignment and overflows on mobile.
- Profile image fixed sizes lead to overlaps.
- Projects grid too wide for phones.
- Inconsistent units (px vs rem).

## Key Technical Concepts
- Bootstrap 5: Use container, row, col-* for responsive grid. Add col-12 on mobile for stacking.
- CSS: Clamp() for fluid sizing, rem/em for scalable spacing, media queries for breakpoints (576px phone, 768px tablet, 992px desktop).
- Flexbox/Grid: Ensure wrap/align on small screens.
- Viewport units: vh for hero height, vw for widths.
- Accessibility: Maintain overflow:hidden where needed, but allow text wrap.

## Relevant Files and Code
- **index.html**
  - Hero: Already has row/col-lg-6; add col-12 for mobile stacking.
  - Sections: Use .container where possible for bounded content.
  - No major changes needed beyond classes.
- **style.css**
  - .epic-hero: Conflicting definitions; consolidate to support Bootstrap stacking.
  - .hero-text/.hero-visual: Remove fixed widths, use 100% on mobile.
  - .hero-avatar: Change to responsive sizing.
  - .projects-grid: Adjust minmax for mobile.
  - Body: Remove conflicting padding-top; let Bootstrap handle.
  - Add/enhance media queries.

## Problem Solving
- Overflows: Add word-break, max-width:100%, box-sizing:border-box everywhere.
- Misalignment: Use justify-content:center, align-items:center in flex.
- Image scaling: object-fit:cover, max-height/width relative.
- Overlaps: z-index adjustments, position:relative.

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
1. Update index.html: Add responsive Bootstrap classes to hero row (e.g., flex-column on small via CSS). [COMPLETED: Row already has flex-column flex-lg-row; changed container-fluid to container in projects, game-jams, contact sections.]
2. Edit style.css: Consolidate hero styles, convert units, fix grids, add mobile paddings.
   - Multiple diffs: Hero fixes, projects grid, timeline, buttons, sections.
   - "Implement clamp for all major sizes; enhance @media max-width:576px for phone specifics."
3. Test: Launch browser to index.html, simulate mobile (note: fixed res 900x600; verify visually).
   - "Use browser_action to check hero on load; scroll to sections for overlaps."
4. Verify full site: Check projects, about, contact on simulated small screens.
   - "If issues in project.html etc., extend fixes."
5. Complete: attempt_completion once verified.

Proceeding with step 2: Edit style.css for major fixes.
