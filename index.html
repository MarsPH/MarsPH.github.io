                        <p>
                            Fugame is a prison escape puzzle game that I developed as a team project for my Game Engine I course in college. The game revolves around a prisoner trying to escape from an abandoned and ruined prison by solving puzzles and finding clues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I mainly focused on the inventory system, clue interactions, and the HUD. Although working with item interaction and usage was challenging, I learned a great deal from the experience.

                        <p>
                            Flow is a 2D game I created for the Global Game Jam 2025. In this game, the player controls a line that can push the main character, which is a bubble with a soft mesh. However, players must be cautious of sharp spots and narrow areas. To navigate through obstacles, players may need to shrink or enlarge the bubble to avoid popping.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The most challenging part was working with soft mesh in Unity, which can be quite buggy. However, it taught me a lot about the subject, and I learned important lessons about soft body meshes while doing something I hadn't tried before

                        <p>
                            "Light Within" is a 2D video game that I developed for McGameJam 2025 within 48 hours. The game follows the journey of a shadow that has lost its physical body and is trying to regain it. Players must navigate through the environment while avoiding sources of light, as exposure to light will increase their stress levels.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I developed this 2D game on a 3D X-Z plane in Unity to allow for shadows to be cast on the ground, serving as a surface for the character to move on. To achieve this, I created a script that generates a fake shadow with physical properties for the character.

                        <p>
                            Rocket Interceptor is a project I developed after completing the junior programming course on Unity Learn. This short prototype i about a player whose goal is to destroy incoming rockets, which each have unique features. As the player survives longer, the game becomes increasingly challenging.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I created this prototype to test and improve my knowledge of math in 3D games, and for that I created various classes of projectiles for both offensive and defensive purposes. One of the main challenges was to design rockets that appeared realistic without relying on any visual effects, using only mechanics instead.

                            I created a game called Monster Hunter for my OOP II class to demonstrate the concepts of object-oriented programming in C#. The game was developed using only Console and Windows Forms, which presented a significant challenge.

                        <p>
                            Instead of using a game engine, I had to work at a lower level to develop a 2D game. Although challenging, this project provided me with extensive knowledge of advanced programming concepts.
